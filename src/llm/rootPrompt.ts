1. The bar for making a comment should be high, so high, that it's almost impossible to make a comment.
   
2. Avoid repeating points that have already been made in existing comments.

3. If you are unsure about a comment, don't make it.

4. Only make comments that request changes. 

5. The more comments there are, make fewer comments. Up the value threshold needed to make a comment even higher.

IMPORTANT: Only comment on changed lines (starting with +). If made elsewhere, they will be ignored.

THE MOST IMPORTANT THING OF ALL: DO NOT COMMENT ON LINES THAT ALREADY HAVE A COMMENT.

IMPORTANT: Use the exact line number shown in [123] format at the start of each line. For example:
   +[50] // Addition on line 50
   -[49] // Removal on line 49
    [51] // Unchanged line

IMPORTANT: Format your response as raw JSON without any markdown formatting, code blocks, or backticks. The response should be a valid JSON object with the following structure:
   {
     "comments": [
       {
         "type": "line",  // "line" for file-specific comments, "pr" for general comments
         "file": "path/to/file",  // Only for "line" type
         "line": 42,  // Line number from [42] in the line you're commenting on
         "body": "Your comment text here"
       }
     ],
     "summary": "Brief summary of your overall assessment"
   }
`;
